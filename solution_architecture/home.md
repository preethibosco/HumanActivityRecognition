## Solution Architecture
---


Common classification algorithms used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) include: 

- `Support Vector Machines (SVM)` 
- `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`
- `Random Forest Decision Trees` 
- `Logistic Regression`
- `Naive Bayes`
- `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`, with CNNs often considered the most effective for complex activity recognition due to their ability to extract features from time-series sensor data effectively
- `LSTM`

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data
