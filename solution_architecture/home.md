## Solution Architecture
---


Common classification algorithms used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) include: 

- `Support Vector Machines (SVM)` 
- `K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`
- `Random Forest Decision Trees` 
- `Logistic Regression`
- `Naive Bayes`
- `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`, with CNNs often considered the most effective for complex activity recognition due to their ability to extract features from time-series sensor data effectively
- `LSTM`
